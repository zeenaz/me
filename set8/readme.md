TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

### How to deal with the continuous data?

1. try `df["column_name"].hist()` to get what you numbers are and how they're distributed
2. If is a time series data (data that changes over time, eg temperature of the laptop)
   1. try `df["column_name"].plot()` to see the trends
   2. how to deal with missing data for any periods of time?
3. try to find the biggest value (max)
4. try to find the smallest value (min)
5. try to find the mean value (mean)
6. try to find the median value (median)
7. try to find the most common value (mode)
