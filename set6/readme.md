TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

I reviewed week 2 readings and wrote some notes about it:

# The Oregon Trail Game - Crossing Rivers

[http://www.died-of-dysentery.com/stories/crossing-rivers.html](http://www.died-of-dysentery.com/stories/crossing-rivers.html)

a simulation game with educational value
you need to pass the rivers
rivers differed in size: width & depth
player needs to make an assessment based on the current conditions
when it is slow and low, it's safe to cross through oxen with a wagon
when it is swift and high, don't even think
sometimes ferry was available with the cost
wait for the river level to go down
caulk the wagon and float it across the river like a boat - a risky option
other problems in the travel

- wagon may break / overturn / stuck

a rich set of possibilities for a simulated game - make decisions as realistic as possible
some times the decisions must be made, the likely consequences may be horrible

how to make this sandbox functional?

1. mathematical model for each four rivers
   1. depth
   2. width
   3. swiftness of the current
   4. types of river bottom
2. climate and weather model
   1. current month
   2. current location
   3. rainfall - sliding scale
3. mathematical models for player's river crossing experience
   - Probability of success
   - current river conditions
   - method of crossing
   - possible problems during the crossing
   1. ford
   2. float
   3. ferry
4. five possible outcomes
   1. safe crossing
   2. swamping
   3. overturning
   4. swept away
   5. stuck in the mud
5. graphic illustration
   1. 45-degree downward angle: see wagon on the river
   2. differently with the scenario

What I got form these?
how did the author managed the database behind?
what are the categorical data
